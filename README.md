## 01 - Modernize with ECS

![ECS Architecture](./images/ecs-cloudmap.drawio.svg "ECS Cluster Architecture")

![CI/CD Architecture](./images/cicd-ecs-blue-green.drawio.svg "CI/CD Pipeline")

ECS cluster with a full blue/green deployment pipeline using AWS native tooling.

**Pipeline flow:**
1. Developer commits → webhook triggers CodePipeline
2. CodeBuild builds Docker image, pushes to ECR, runs pytest + Trivy security scan
3. Pipeline fails on test or scan failure; on success sends an SNS approval notification
4. After manual approval, CodeDeploy performs blue/green deployment to ECS

**Cluster hardening:**
- ECS Exec via SSM Session Manager, encrypted with KMS
- Container Insights enabled
- WAF attached to the load balancer
- Route 53 + ACM for HTTPS termination

## 02 - Centralized VPC Endpoints

![Centralized VPC Endpoints](./images/centralized-vpce.drawio.svg "Centralized VPC Endpoints")

All AWS service VPC endpoints live in a single hub VPC. Spoke VPCs resolve them via Route 53 Private Hosted Zones, with private DNS resolution disabled at the endpoint level.

**Why it matters:** In a multi-VPC account, you'd normally create the same VPC endpoints in every VPC. This pattern cuts that down to one set — significant cost saving as the number of VPCs grows.

**Design constraints:**
- Endpoint resource policies are capped at 20,480 characters — plan carefully when many VPCs share endpoints
- Endpoint ENIs auto-scale under traffic spikes — allocate enough IP space in the hub VPC

---

## 03 - Centralized Egress

![Centralized Egress](./images/centralized-egress.drawio.svg "Centralized Egress Architecture")

Single NAT Gateway exit point shared across multiple spoke VPCs via Transit Gateway.

**Traffic path:** Spoke VPC → Transit Gateway → Egress VPC → NAT Gateway → Internet Gateway

**Why it matters:** NAT Gateway costs scale with the number of VPCs. This pattern replaces N NAT Gateways with one, which meaningfully reduces cost in environments with many spoke VPCs.

→ [03-centralized-egress/](./03-centralized-egress/)

## 04 - Modernize with EKS

![EKS Architecture](./images/eks-architecture.drawio.svg "EKS Architecture")

End-to-end production EKS setup built as 6 progressive stacks, each layered on the previous.

| Stack | What it does |
|---|---|
| `0-baseline` | EKS 1.33, managed node groups (AL2023, gp3, IMDSv2), add-ons, RDS PostgreSQL 17, IAM |
| `1-deploy-apps` | Flask backend + Nginx frontend, Secrets Store CSI Driver, ALB ingress |
| `2-hpa` | Horizontal Pod Autoscaler + Pod Disruption Budget |
| `3-cicd` | CodeCommit → CodePipeline → CodeBuild → ECR → EKS |
| `4-gitops-argocd` | ArgoCD + Argo Rollouts (blue/green) + ArgoCD Image Updater + ECR token refresher CronJob |
| `5-monitoring` | kube-prometheus-stack — Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana on gp3 EBS |

→ [04-modernize-with-eks/](./04-modernize-with-eks/)

---

## 05 - Modernize with EKS Fargate

EKS cluster running entirely on AWS Fargate — no EC2 node groups, no node patching, no capacity planning.

- OIDC provider for IRSA
- Fargate profiles for `kube-system`, `coredns`, `default`
- Add-ons configured with `computeType = Fargate`
- CoreDNS Fargate profile must exist before the add-on is applied (ordering handled in Terraform)

→ [05-modernize-with-eks-fargate/](./05-modernize-with-eks-fargate/)

---

## 06 - Speed Up CI/CD

Terraform provider caching in CodeBuild via S3 cache. The `.terraform` directory is cached between pipeline runs so providers and modules are not re-downloaded on every trigger.

**Impact:** Faster pipeline runs and lower data transfer costs — the benefit compounds as the Terraform codebase grows and more providers are used.

**Stack:** GitHub → CodePipeline → CodeBuild (S3 cache)
